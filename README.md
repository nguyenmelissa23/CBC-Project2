2. Change directory to the project folder in terminal.

3. Run 'npm install'

4. Run 'node server.js'

5. Open 'http://localhost:8000/' in browser.

## Usage

The piano keys start with asdfg.

Drum keys are 45678.

## Technologies
[Qwerty Hancock](https://stuartmemo.com/qwerty-hancock/) - used to generate a responsive keyboard for playing notes.

[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) - used for sound manipulation and visualization.

[Web Audio DAW](https://github.com/rserota/wad#configuring-reverb) - a library that utilizes the Web Audio API to help with sound manipulation.

### CORS configuration: 

Go to AWS S3 and create a bucket. Upload your file here.

Go to Permissions > CORS configuration and modified the code in the CORS configuration editor with this code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>
    <ExposeHeader>ETag</ExposeHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration> 
```

Make all files public by going to the Objects tabs, choose all your files and click More > Make public.

To get the file link, click on the file and a board should popup with the file's link. 


### Visualizer with WAD.js 

The AnalyserNode is created within the WAD.js and the challenge here is to actually find this node in your WAD object. 

Do NOT create another AnalyserNode since this would most likely override the current one that already exists.
